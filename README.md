# 🎂 KK&Cakes Reminder System – Detailed Diagram Review

The **KK&Cakes Reminder System** is a smart digital feature that allows customers to receive friendly reminders to order cakes before their special events — birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, and graduations.  
It uses automated scheduling, personalized messages, and a smooth order process to strengthen customer engagement and boost sales.

This documentation provides a **detailed explanation** of the four key diagrams that define the design, structure, and flow of the KK&Cakes system:  
**Flowchart, Sequence Diagram, Class Diagram, and ER Diagram.**

## 🧩 1. Flowchart – System Workflow

### 📜 Description
The **flowchart** represents the entire process flow of the reminder system from start to finish.  
It begins when a customer signs up or logs in, enters event details, and ends with the system sending reminders and confirming new orders.  
This visual helps both technical and non-technical users understand the **logical steps** in the system’s operation.

### 🧠 Key Points
- **Start to End Visualization:** Displays every major step, from registration to order confirmation.  
- **Decision Logic:** Includes a conditional check for upcoming events within 3–5 days.  
- **Automation Emphasis:** Shows how the system automatically triggers reminders without manual action.  
- **Customer Journey:** Demonstrates how the customer receives reminders and places an order directly through the app or website.

### 🎯 Purpose
To provide a **clear, top-level overview** of how the reminder process works — making it easier to communicate the logic flow to developers, managers, and stakeholders.

## 🔄 2. Sequence Diagram – System Interaction Flow

### 📜 Description
The **sequence diagram** shows how different components of the system communicate over time.  
It highlights how data moves between the **Customer**, **App**, **Database**, **Scheduler**, and **Notification Service** in a step-by-step order.

### 🧠 Key Points
- **User Interaction:** Begins with a customer adding an event date.  
- **Database Operations:** The app stores this information securely in the database.  
- **Automation:** A scheduler runs daily to check if any event is due soon.  
- **Notifications:** Personalized reminders are sent via email, SMS, or in-app alerts.  
- **Order Conversion:** When the customer clicks the reminder link, an order is automatically created and confirmed.

### 🎯 Purpose
To illustrate the **real-time flow of actions and messages** within the system.  
It helps developers and designers understand **how different components interact** and at what stage each process occurs.

## 🧱 3. Class Diagram – System Structure

### 📜 Description
The **class diagram** represents the **object-oriented architecture** of the KK&Cakes system.  
It defines all the main classes (or entities), their properties (attributes), and how they are related to one another.

### 🧠 Key Points
- **Customer Class:** Contains user information like name, email, and preferred contact channel.  
- **Event Class:** Stores event details such as name and date, connected to a specific customer.  
- **Reminder Class:** Handles the scheduling and delivery of notifications tied to each event.  
- **Order Class:** Records purchase details triggered by reminders or direct orders.  
- **OrderItem and Product Classes:** Capture specific product details for each order, including quantities and pricing.

### 🎯 Purpose
To define the **data structure** of the system in a logical, object-oriented manner.  
It helps backend developers and database designers build a consistent and maintainable codebase by understanding how entities are **linked and interdependent**.

## 🗄️ 4. ER Diagram – Database Relationships

### 📜 Description
The **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** provides a **database-level view** of how information is stored and connected in the KK&Cakes system.  
It visualizes tables, columns, and relationships such as one-to-many and many-to-one connections.

### 🧠 Key Points
- **Customer–Event Relationship:** Each customer can have multiple events (e.g., birthday, anniversary).  
- **Event–Reminder Relationship:** Each event can generate multiple reminders depending on scheduling.  
- **Customer–Order Relationship:** A customer can place multiple orders, often linked to reminders.  
- **Order–OrderItem–Product Relationship:** Orders contain specific items referencing the product catalog.  
- **Referential Integrity:** Ensures all relationships maintain accurate and linked data between tables.
